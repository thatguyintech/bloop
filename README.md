# GM Website Full-Stack Solidity Smart Contract Demo

This project showcases how to:
1. Write a Solidity smart contract
2. Create a Hardhat deploy script
3. Deploy to Rinkeby testnet using Alchemy
4. Build a simple React frontend website that reads and writes to the Ethereum blockchain using the smart contract functions

Use `npm init` to install dependencies.

Use `npm start` to load the website locally.

This is what the site will look like when you have successfully gm'd:
![gm](./gm)
